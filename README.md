# CAGE

CAGE is a simple 2D Game Creation Framework, i created to teach myself DirectX, the CAGE uses D3D11 and is implemented using C/C++. If you find any errors or have suggestions for better code organization, please free fell to open an issue to help me improve ‚ù§.

You don't need the premake to use this project. If you prefer not to install premake, simply delete the `premake5.lua`.

## Why use Premake?

i use Premake because my computer has limited resources, and premake with VSCode is the most efficient option to my setup.

Premake is used to create and configure `.sln` and `.vcxproj` files. I use VSCode for coding and `Developer Command Prompt for VS2022` to compile the project.
